# Java-Task2
Task2 
The task 2 can only be completed because of the easiness of it. I could not complete the first task becausse of the work load of mine and also working on current project..
I have worked as Linux Administrator, Web Development an DevOps Engineer
I am expert in Java Technology and C++ as well as Python.


The task 2 is about building an image in Java using Gradle plugin
First, we use a simple Docker File,then I built the command using gradle-Built cocmmand, before running the Docker.
